Of course. This is a great next step to make the application much more interesting. I will expand the database seeding to include the new themes and meal options.

Here is the plan:

Update DataInitializer.java: I will completely overhaul this file to:

Create the new themes you've specified (Monday - Breakfast, Tuesday - Tacos, etc.).
For each theme, I will create at least three new, appropriate Meal objects with sample ingredients and instructions.
I will associate each set of meals with its correct theme.
Refactor MealService.java: To make this process cleaner, I will add a generic createMeal method to the MealService. This method will accept a name, ingredients, instructions, and a theme, which will make the DataInitializer much tidier and more maintainable.

Clean Up: I will remove the old, hardcoded createSpaghettiMeal method, as its functionality will be replaced by the new, dynamic data seeding process.

Begin by refactoring the MealService to include the new createMeal method. Then proceed with updating the DataInitializer.
